<h1>Terms and Conditions - Case Update Subscriptions - Umpire</h1>
<h2>Understand how we use the information you provide</h2>
<p>To subscribe you to updates on a case, we have to store your e-mail address in a way that lets us read it and send emails. Although we do our best to make sure only trusted people get to see the address you submit, we are not responsible for the communication between you and us. Since we operate in the USA, chances are that government agencies like the NSA are capturing everything you send, and everything we display to anyone. If you need to keep your email address secret from the American government, do not enter it into our system.</p>
<p>We will not divulge any part of the email address you submit to anyone, unless you specifically allow it, with the exception of being forced to release specifics to law enforcement, and as needed for sending the case update emails. </p>
<p>If you entered the case anonymously, we will create an anonymous user account for you. We will not tie the email address you provide for this subscription to that account. But subscribing to a case will tie your email address to that case.</p>
<p>Feel free to submit any questions and concerns via our <a href="/umpire/feedback/">feedback form</a>.</p>
