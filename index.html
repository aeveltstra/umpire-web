<h2>Unidentified and Missing People Investigation, Registry, and Education</h2>
<p>We specialize in finding and naming people from marginalized communities. People who otherwise get ignored, devalued, diminished, silenced.</p>
<p>We liaise with law enforcement on your behalf, so you don't have to.</p>
<p>We never give up. We keep looking. No case is too hard.</p>
<p>Our methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forensic Genetic Geneaology: family trees based on DNA testing,</li>
<li>Web sleuthing: searching social media, news paper archives, and public databases world-wide,</li>
<li>Building solid report with agencies and research centers across the globe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our database is protected. We accept entries from the public in general, but give read access only to trusted contacts, and law enforcement if so required.</p>
<p>To enter details of your missing loved one, use <a href="forms/missing/">this missing-person's entry form</a>.</p>
<p>For contact and support, use <a href="forms/feedback/">this feedback form</a>.</p>
