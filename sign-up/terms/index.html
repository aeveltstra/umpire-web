    <h1>Terms and Conditions - Signing Up - Umpire</h1>
    <h2>Understand how we use the information you provide</h2>
    <p>When you request access to the Umpire system, we receive a
        notification containing the email address you gave us.
        We need that because we have no other way of recognizing you.</p>
    <p>We do not store your email address in our system. Neither do we
        store your access key or your secret pass phrase. Instead, we
        store one-way hashes of that information, using NIST-approved
        hashing algorithms available at the time of writing. If our
        system were to get breached, hackers will have a hard time
        figuring out your email address and pass phrase. This reduces
        the usefulness of that data, reducing the chance they will sell
        it to others.</p>
    <p>Although we do our best to make sure only trusted people get to
        see your request, we are not responsible for the communication
        between you and us. Since we operate in the USA, chances are that
        government agencies like the NSA
        are capturing everything you send, and everything we display to
        anyone. If you need to keep your request secret
        from the American government, do not enter it into our system.
    </p>
    <p>We will not divulge any part of the case information you submit
        unless you specifically allow it, with the
        exception of being forced to release specifics to law
        enforcement. But even law enforcement cannot force us to
        decrypt your email address, access key, or secret pass phrase,
        because we simply do not store them in a
        decryptable manner. We create one-way hashes and store those.</p>
    <p>Feel free to submit any questions and concerns via our <a
            href="/umpire/forms/feedback/">feedback form</a>.</p>
