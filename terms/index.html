<p>After you submit a case, you get to see that case, and only that case.  You can request a hyperlink to the case be sent to your email, so you can review the case later.</p>
<p>Although we do our best to make sure only trusted people get to see the case you submit, we are not responsible for the communication between you and us. Since we operate in the USA, chances are that government agencies like the NSA are capturing everything you send, and everything we display to anyone. If you need to keep your case information secret from the American government, do not enter it into our database.</p>
<p>We will not divulge any part of the case information you submit unless you specifically allow it, with the exception of being forced to release specifics to law enforcement. </p>
